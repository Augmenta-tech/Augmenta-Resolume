A collection of [Resolume](https://resolume.com/) Augmenta plugins made with Wire and ISF shaders that takes [Augmenta](https://www.augmenta.tech) data as input

> Note : All those plugins are currently prototype we are working on, and use a new protocol, please contact us if you have a real project

Video tutorial and documentation here : // INSERT RESOLUME DOC LINK

## Code your own plugin

Prerequisite : Having a wire license

- Create a new wire project

- Use the example ISF shader as a starting point

Tips : You can use Wire or this online editor for editing : https://editor.isf.video/

Note : If you want to export a compiled plugin for [Resolume](https://resolume.com/) (meaning you don't want people to get your code), you need to have [Resolume wire](https://resolume.com/software/wire) installed
