# Troubleshooting



**Don't see point moving ?**&#x20;

* Make sure you have objects in the Augmenta Simulator scene
* Make sure you have the same OSC Input in Resolume as the Remote Port in Augmenta Fusion
* You can debug by clicking on Log Updates in Augmenta Fusion. You should see the sending bundle in the logger
* You can also see the received bundle in Resolume : "Arena" > "Preferences" > "OSC", then click on the arrow at the top right of the window that opens

If your issue is not resolved, you can ask questions on our [discord](https://discord.gg/ErWESYXR9x) !
